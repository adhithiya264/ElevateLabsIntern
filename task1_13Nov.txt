potential threats/risks through the open ports:

21 (FTP) - Anonymous login could allow attackers to upload/download files.
Brute-force attacks on weak FTP credentials.
Cleartext credentials (FTP transmits username/password without encryption).

22 (SSH)- Exploits on outdated SSH servers (e.g., OpenSSH vulnerabilities).
Privilege escalation if root login allowed remotely.
Misconfiguration (e.g., weak keys, default ports not changed).

23 (Telnet)- Plaintext communication — credentials easily sniffed.
Remote code execution vulnerabilities in old telnet daemons.
Brute-force or default credentials (common in IoT devices).

53 (DNS) - DNS amplification attacks (used in DDoS).
Zone transfer (AXFR) if not restricted — leaks internal DNS data.
Cache poisoning or spoofing (if not properly configured).

80 (HTTP)- Web app vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, RCE, etc.)
Directory listing enabled — data leakage
Default/old pages exposing sensitive info

443 (HTTPS)- SSL/TLS misconfiguration (weak ciphers, expired certs).
Web app exploits (same as port 80 — HTTPS doesn’t make the app itself secure).
OpenSSL vulnerabilities (e.g., Heartbleed).
