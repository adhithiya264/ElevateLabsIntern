Analysis:

The domain uses micros0ft (with a zero 0) instead of Microsoft.
Legit Microsoft emails come from @microsoft.com, @account.microsoft.com,
The email claims to be from Microsoft, but replies go to a completely unrelated domain.
This mismatch is a major red flag used to route your response to attackers.
Microsoft knows your name.
Phishing mails often use broad greetings to target many people at once.
Microsoft never uses URL shorteners like Bit.ly.
Shortened URLs hide the true destination → major red flag.
Link text says one thing, but the destination is different.
Phishers disguise malicious pages behind trustworthy-looking words.
Tone is slightly informal for a corporate security alert.
Real Microsoft emails follow strict formatting templates.

So the given mail is a phishing email.
